Source Code for implementations using the LunarLanderV2 environment from OpenAI Gym. 

Using Deep-Q Learning with experience replay, the agent can achieve multiple episodes with passing scores of over 200 in 
about 60-70 episodes of training. 

NOTE: if you want to run these files on your own computer, you will have to edit the directory variables inside the files to match your 
directories

Improvements need to be done so that the agent can consistently obtain a passing score of at least 200 in 10 consecutive episodes.

In addition, I have tried to export the weights of the agent after training to use in another file but when used through importing the .h5
file the agent performs as if it had not been trained before.
